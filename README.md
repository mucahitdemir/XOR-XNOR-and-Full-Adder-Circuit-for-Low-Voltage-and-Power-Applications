# XOR-XNOR-and-Full-Adder-Circuit-for-Low-Voltage-and-Power-Applications
In this paper, a new full adder circuit was developed by an assistance report paper from Hanho Lee and Gerald E. Sobelman. It is an essential point to have low voltage operation as the dynamic power dissipation is proportional to V2 dd. The new designed full adder has low power dissipation.
